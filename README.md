# Cyber-Threat-Scanner-Python
A cyber threat scanner using python
This program is designed to help identify potential cyber threats on a network. When you connect computers to a network, they can communicate with each other and share information, but this also means that they can be vulnerable to security risks. Hackers and malicious software can try to gain access to your network through open ports or known vulnerabilities, and if left unchecked, these threats can cause serious damage.

To help detect these potential security risks, this program uses a tool called Nmap. Nmap is a tool that can scan a network and provide a detailed report of all the connected devices, open ports, running services, and potential vulnerabilities. With this information, network administrators can identify potential security risks and take steps to protect their network.

The program has a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows you to enter the IP address range of the network you want to scan. The IP address range is a set of numbers that identify all the computers on a network. By entering this range, you're telling the program which computers to scan for potential threats.

Once you've entered the IP address range, you can click the "Start Scan" button to begin the scanning process. The program will use Nmap to scan every IP address in the range you specified. This can take some time, depending on the size of your network and the speed of your computer.

While Nmap is scanning the network, it will identify all the open ports and potential vulnerabilities on each computer. When the scanning process is complete, the program will create a report that lists all the connected devices, open ports, and potential vulnerabilities that were detected. This report can help you identify which devices on your network may be vulnerable to attack, and what steps you can take to protect them.

Finally, the program allows you to save the report to an output file so that you can review the results later or share them with others. The report will be saved in a format that is easy to read and understand, with detailed information about each connected device, open port, and potential vulnerability.

I hope that explanation helps!
